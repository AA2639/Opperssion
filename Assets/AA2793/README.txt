Packages used:  Input system
                Cinemachine

The character and animations have been downloaded from mixamo.com
I have followed a tutorial from udemy as i do not have any experience with unity nor animations on it.
I have spend more than 10 hours doing this material, even though i followed a step by step course. 
Thanks to this course I have learned how to animate a character though unity.
Link to the course: https://www.udemy.com/course/create-a-third-person-player-character-controller/

Basic movements of a character: WASD for character movements
                                SPACE Bar for jumping

The controls have been implemented using unity's IMPUT SYSTEM and CINEMACHINE to follow the character.
Different animations are triggered depending if it is moving or not, how long the space bar is pressed,
the combination of both (movement and jumping) or an automatic animation trigger if the character is falling.

//Update 16.03

Added some background music and sound effects tied to animations (gun , steps forward and steps backward). Finally i added sound of jumping triggered via the input system (when pressing space) instead of the jump animation.
All the information i used for the sound system i got it throughrandom youtube videos or articles from the internet. I also did a new file just dor the sound scripts which. Next step should be to refractor the AlexController script and make the world slightly more beautiful and responsive, right now it is not.

Finally i also added some "drones" to shoot, which i took from the course i was following.
